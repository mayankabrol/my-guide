Here findNextPalindrome file contains the code for finding the next palindrome where we have first input t i.e. the number of cases we are about to enter. And then we can go on adding the cases for which the results will be shown at the console.
Now about the code, While one goes on enterring the inputs for generating the next palindromes, the palindromes would appear on spot, and not altogether in the end.
Also, we have junit test cases attached with it that can be executed in Eclipse IDE.
